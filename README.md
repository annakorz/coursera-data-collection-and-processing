# Project: OMDB and TasteDive Mash Up

Final project for Coursera course "Python 3: Data Collection and Processing"

The task was to get data from two different APIs to make movie recommendations.
A query was sent to TasteDive to get a list of related movies and OMDB was requested for data about the movie to further sort the whole list of movies in accordance with their Rotten Tomatoes rating.

The task was decomposed into several steps with more detailed instructions on what should be done.

As the project was tested in the online interactive textbook, a special module requests_with_caching was used to get data not directly from APIs that require keys but from existing cache.
